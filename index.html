    <h1>Morphological Editor Design for Grayscale Images Using Quantum Cellular Automaton</h1>
    <h1>Mathematical Morphology</h1>
    <h3>First and foremost, lets take a brief moment to disguise about the basics.</h3>
    
    <p>Mathematical morphology is a branch of mathematical image processing and computer vision that 
        deals with the analysis and processing of geometric structures in images and other spatially organized data. 
        It was introduced by the French mathematician Georges Matheron in the 1960s and further developed by Jean Serra.
    </p>
    <p>The fundamental concept in mathematical morphology is the use of structuring elements, also known as kernels or masks, 
        to probe an image or data set in order to extract meaningful information. These structuring elements are small patterns or shapes, 
        often represented as binary matrices or sets of coordinates. 
        They are used to explore and modify the pixels or elements of an image based on their spatial arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>The main operations in mathematical morphology include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Normal Image</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Grayscale Image</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Erosion</p>
        <p>Erosion is an operation that reduces the size of bright regions (foreground) in an image by scanning the image 
          with a structuring element and setting the center pixel of the structuring element to the minimum value in the neighborhood. 
          It erodes the boundaries of the regions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Dilation</p>
        <p>Dilation is the opposite of erosion. It increases the size of bright regions in an image by scanning the image 
          with a structuring element and setting the center pixel of the structuring element to the maximum value in the neighborhood.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Opening</p>
        <p>Opening is a combination of erosion followed by dilation. 
          It helps to remove small objects and noise from an image while preserving the overall shape of larger structures.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p >Closing</p>
        <p>
          Closing is the reverse of opening, combining dilation followed by erosion. 
          It helps to fill small gaps and holes in objects while preserving the overall structure.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Hit-or-miss transform</p>
        <p>
          This operation is used to detect specific patterns in an image 
          by defining two structuring elements, one for the foreground and one for the background.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The morphological operations first applied to binary images and later for   
      grayscale images, and even other types of spatially organized data beyond images.

        <p>You can upload any Image as long as it's jpg, jpeg, png or ico otherwise console.log will print false.</p>
        <p>There is no database so the image (as also the rendering) is executed completely in your PC.</p>
        <p>
          The neighborhood is set to 11(array of 11x11) in order for the rendering to be visible. If neighborhood was a 3x3 or 5x5 area the 
          effect wouldn't be so distinct. This way it would only make some difference in lower resolution images.
